<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Once you assemble the class, you can compare the model against the standalone Decision tree from Stage 1. To do that, fit your <code class="java">RandomForestClassifier</code> and make a prediction for all of the objects in the training set. After that, print the resulting accuracy.</p>
<p>At this point, you can fiddle with the model parameters. Try changing the number of trees and/or other model parameters to see how accuracy varies. It is not required to complete the objective but would provide a more fulfilling experience.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Fit your <code class="java">RandomForestClassifier</code> on the whole training set;</li>
<li>Predict labels for all of the objects in the test set.</li>
<li>Calculate and print the resulting accuracy rounded to three digits after the dot (for example, 3.141). Is the accuracy better or worse than the one in Stage 1?</li>
</ol>
